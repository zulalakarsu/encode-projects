# Story character extractor app using ts-playground 

## Project tasks

- Use the ts-playground as a foundation or develop a new application from scratch using Next.js
- Design a page with a single input field for .txt file uploads. Users should upload a book or similar content with characters and settings
- Implement a button to extract characters from the uploaded file
- Develop a RAG pipeline to extract characters from the uploaded file. Each character should have a name, description, and personality
- Add a text area below the button to display the results
- Convert the output from the AI into an array of objects and present it in a table format
(optional) Modify the retrieveandquery.ts file to use Structured Outputs to make it easier to process the response
- Integrate the ts-playground project with the story-telling-app to enable users to create new stories using imported characters, reusing their descriptions and personalities inside the stories being generated by the AI
