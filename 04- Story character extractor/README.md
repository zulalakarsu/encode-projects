# Story Character Extractor App Using ts-playground  

## Overview  

This application extracts character details (names, descriptions, and personality traits) from uploaded `.txt` files and enables the creation of new AI-generated stories using those extracted characters. Built with **Next.js** and powered by **LlamaIndex** and **OpenAI**, the app features a RAG pipeline for text processing and character extraction.

## Project Tasks  

- Use the ts-playground as a foundation or develop a new application from scratch using Next.js
- Design a page with a single input field for .txt file uploads
- Users should upload a book or similar content with characters and settings
- Implement a button to extract characters from the uploaded file
- Develop a RAG pipeline to extract characters from the uploaded file
- Each character should have a name, description, and personality
- Add a text area below the button to display the results
- Convert the output from the AI into an array of objects and present it in a table format
- (optional) Modify the retrieveandquery.ts file to use Structured Outputs to make it easier to process the response
- Integrate the ts-playground project with the story-telling-app to enable users to create new stories using imported characters, reusing their descriptions and personalities inside the stories being generated by the AI

## How It Works

1. Users upload a `.txt` file containing story content.  
2. The backend processes the file to extract characters (name, description, personality).  
3. Results are displayed in a **text area** and organized into a table format.  
4. Users can use the extracted characters to generate new AI-powered stories.
