Week 1 Weekend Project: ChefGPT 

This project focuses on creating and experimenting with an AI chef assistant that responds with unique personalities. Each team member develops a distinct AI chef script with a specific culinary style, such as an enthusiastic Indian chef or a seasoned Italian pasta expert. The AI responds to three types of requests: ingredient-based dish suggestions, recipe requests, and constructive critiques for improvement.

**Inputs & Outputs** 
- For ingredient inputs: Suggest only dish names without full recipes.
- For dish name inputs: Provide a detailed recipe.
- For recipe inputs: Offer a constructive critique with suggested improvements.

**Experimentation Process:**
1. The first person uses one AI chef personality to suggest a dish based on given ingredients, then shares the response with a teammate.
2. The second person requests a recipe for that dish using a different AI chef personality and shares the response with another teammate.
3. The third person critiques the recipe using a third AI chef personality.

**Report**
- The experiment process
- The system prompts used in each script
- Comparative analysis of the different user prompts and their responses
